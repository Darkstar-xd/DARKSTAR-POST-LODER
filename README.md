Usage

1. Run the Tool
Start the tool by running:

python Main.py


2. Approval & Authentication

The tool generates a unique ID based on your system data and checks it against an online approval list hosted on GitHub.

If not yet approved, an automatic WhatsApp request is sent.

You will be prompted to enter a password. Upon correct entry, you gain access to the menu.



3. Menu Options
Choose from the available options:

[1] START LOADER: Launch the main tool functions.

[2] TOKEN CHECKER: Validate Facebook tokens.

[3] GC UID FINDER: Retrieve group chat UIDs.

[4] GET PAGE TOKEN: Extract page tokens.

[5] EXIT: Terminate the session.



4. Additional Functionalities

The tool uses a combination of system commands and API calls to provide real-time status and feedback.

It supports proxy usage and rotates user-agents for each API request to enhance anonymity.

Security & Authentication

Automated Approval
Darkstar_pro uses a unique, system-derived token for approval via a GitHub-hosted list. This ensures only authorized users can access the tool.

Password Protection
A fixed password (customizable in code) is used to restrict access. Only a limited number of attempts are allowed.

Obfuscation & Self-Destruct
Critical components of the code are obfuscated. In case of tampering or repeated failed password attempts, the tool auto-terminates to protect its integrity.


> Note: The current obfuscation and security methods are intended to deter casual reverse engineering. For stronger security, consider integrating advanced key management and anti-debugging techniques.
